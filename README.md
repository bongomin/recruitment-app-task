# recruitment-app-task

This is a recruitment site that allows users to login, sign up, view their profile details, and browse available jobs from specific regions.

## Folder Structure
The project consists of two folders:

- `next-client`: Contains the next js 13 client-side code for the recruitment site developed using Next.js 13.
- `node-server`: Contains the server-side code developed using Express.js and PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Setting up the Backend

1. Clone the repository.
- `git clone git@github.com:bongomin/recruitment-app-task.git`

2 cd into the folder
`cd recruitment-app-task`

2. Create a PostgreSQL database called `recruitmentwebsite`.

3. Navigate to the `node-server` folder and run the following commands:
   ```shell
   npm install
   npm start

This will install the required packages and start the server. The necessary user and recruitment tables will be automatically created for you.

## Setting up the Client


Navigate to the `next-client` folder and run the following commands:
npm install
npm run dev

This will install the required packages and run the client application.

## Usage

Once the backend and client are set up and running, you can access the recruitment website in your browser. Use the provided login and signup functionality to authenticate as a user. You can then view your profile details and browse the available job listings from specific regions.

## Disclaimer:
 Due to time constraints, I was unable to complete the integration and frontend functionalities of the project. 
 However, I have submitted the work that I was able to complete as soon as possible.
 Thank you for your understanding and consideration.
